CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS:

1.Challenge: Identifying correct table relationships

  Solution: Used ER modeling principles to map real-world scenarios

2.Challenge: Avoiding data duplication

  Solution: Applied normalization rules systematically

3.Challenge: Balancing simplicity with completeness
  
  Solution: Included only essential attributes based on use-case

4.Challenge: Ensuring referential integrity across multiple related tables
  
  Solution: Primary key and foreign key constraints were used to maintain valid references between customers, orders, products, and order_items. 
  This ensures that orders cannot exist without a valid customer and order items cannot exist without valid orders and products, thereby maintaining data consistency and integrity throughout the database. 

5.Challenge: Handling price changes for products over time without affecting historical data
  
  Solution: The unit_price attribute was stored in the order_items table to capture the price at the time of purchase. 
  
  This approach prevents historical order data from being altered when product prices change in the products table.
