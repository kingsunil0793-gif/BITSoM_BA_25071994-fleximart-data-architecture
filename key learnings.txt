Key Learnings:


1.Importance of normalization in database design

  Applying Third Normal Form (3NF) helped eliminate redundancy and ensured that each data element is stored only once. 
  This improves storage efficiency and reduces the risk of inconsistent data.

2.Role of functional dependencies

  Identifying functional dependencies made it easier to determine correct primary keys and ensured that non-key attributes depend only on the primary key, which is essential for achieving 3NF compliance.

3.Significance of entity relationships

  Clearly defined one-to-many and many-to-many relationships allowed accurate modeling of real-world business processes such as customers placing multiple orders and orders containing multiple products.

4.Prevention of data anomalies

  Separating data into well-structured tables prevents update, insert, and delete anomalies, thereby maintaining data accuracy and reliability over time.

5.Designing for scalability and maintainability

  A normalized schema allows the database to scale efficiently as data volume increases and simplifies future modifications without impacting existing data integrity
